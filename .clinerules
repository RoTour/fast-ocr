docs in ./docs/*

Before making changes, always define a small iteration that you can make in one go.

When you're done, ask for a review.

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. When implementing any feature, tests **MUST be written BEFORE** the actual implementation code.
See TestingStrategy.md for more details.
